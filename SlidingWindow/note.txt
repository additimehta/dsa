Core Idea:
- suppose you have an array and we want to analyze
- create a smaller window and move it around the array to check criteras
- Hence the word sliding window
- the window's area is dynamic so it can increase and decrease in length


[    <--  [ W I N D O W ]  -->  ]


Approaches:

- Fixed Lenght Window
    - the lenght is fixed and moves left to right across the array 
- Dynamically Resizable Windows
    - instead of just sliding the smaller window left to right start from left
        and increase the size of the window making it bigger and bigger to see if it fits the critera
        then change the left position a bit to the right. Think of a caterpillar moving up a tree





Common Types of Problems:
- a constant metric : some attribute of the sum the # of unique elements,
                        the frequency of a specific element or another attribute


- numeric restriction : what is the constraint metric should be for subarray to be considered valid



Examples:
- Find the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to k
- Find the longest substring that has the most "0"
- Find the number of subarrays that have the product less than k
